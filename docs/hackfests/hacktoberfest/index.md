# Hacktoberfest

[#Hacktoberfest] is a global annual hackathon event that spans through the entire month of October. It celebrates
Open Source Software and encourages companies and developers to contribute to Open Source projects. The main goal of the
event is to raise the awareness for the Open Source community, but also to get both a wider adoption and an increase
in the contributions and contributors to such projects. [#Hacktoberfest] is open to developers all levels of experience.  

[#Hacktoberfest] is sponsored by [DigitalOcean], [Github] and [Twilio].

We are pleased to let you know that we have been participating in [#Hacktoberfest] since 2017! We are open to new
contributors and would like to welcome you to our project!
