# Grace Hopper Celebration Opensource Day

In continuation of our involvement in previous [hackfests][hackfests], such as [#Hacktoberfest], we have been invited to
participate in the [Grace Hopper Celebration 2020 Opensource Day][anitab-ghc-oss-day]. We are thrilled to be taking part
in such a fantastic event that promotes diversity and inclusion and tries to get more women involved in the software
industry! 

## Who Was Grace Hopper?

Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. She was one of the first
programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer and a pioneer in computer programming. She invented one of the first linkers
and popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early
high-level programming language still in use today.

## Grace Hopper Celebration

To honor Grace Hopper’s legacy and inspire future generations of women in tech, Dr. Anita Borg and Dr. Telle Whitney 
founded Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) in 1994. The AnitaB.org flagship event brings the research and career interests 
of women in computing to the forefront, and highlights the contributions of women to the tech world.

The Celebration results in collaborative proposals, networking, and mentoring for our attendees. GHC presenters are 
leaders in their respective fields who recognize the importance of diversity in tech. The Celebration also offers 
professional development through a variety of activities. Today, GHC is the world’s largest gathering of women 
technologists, where women from around the world learn, network, and celebrate their achievements.

AnitaB.org co-presents GHC with the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).

## What is AnitaB.org?

AnitaB.org is a nonprofit social enterprise inciting a movement to achieve intersectional equity in the global technical 
workforce by 2025. AnitaB.org/365 programs empower women and under-tapped communities in technical fields, guide the 
organizations that employ them, and support the academic institutions training the next generation. Founded in 1997 by 
our namesake, computer science visionary [Anita Borg][anitab-homepage], and her co-founder and fellow computer scientist, 
Telle Whitney, AnitaB.org is driving a future where the people who imagine and build technology will mirror the people 
and societies for whom they build it.
